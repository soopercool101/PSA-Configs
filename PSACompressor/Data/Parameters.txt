Angle Flip
0,1: the target is always sent away from the attacker. (Regular) 2: The target direction is not change. 3: Forward; based on the direction of the attacker. 4: Backward; based on the opposite direction of the attacker. 5: the target is always sent away from the center of offensive collision. 6,7: Now THIS is a wacky one. A hitbox with this as an angle flipper will cause the target to face the screen. They will be unable to walk or run, but they can move through the air normally. They will be unable to use f-tilts, and using an air attack in either direction produces a fair. Special moves tend to act as if the character is facing right. Knockback taken by these hitboxes will have no horizontal component. Getting hit by something else, using an f-smash, or using a side special will end the strangeness.
