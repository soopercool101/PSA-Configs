Boolean
Unknown, might be unused.
Value

Boolean
Unknown, might be unused.
Shieldability
True=Blockable, False=Unblockable
Reflectability
True=Can be reflected, False=Cannot be reflected
Absorbability
True=Can be absorbed, False=Cannot be absorbed
Rehit Rate
How many frames between each hitbox refresh; for example a value of 8 will cause the hitbox to hit every 9 frames. A value of 0 disables refreshing; the hitbox will only hit once.
Piercing
True=Ignores invincibility, False=Does not ignore invincibility
Boolean
Unknown, might be unused.
Angle Flip
0,2,5: Regular angles; the target is always sent away from the attacker. 1,3: The target is always sent the direction the attacker is facing. 4: The target is always sent the direction the attacker is not facing. 6,7: Now THIS is a wacky one. A hitbox with this as an angle flipper will cause the target to face the screen. They will be unable to walk or run, but they can move through the air normally. They will be unable to use f-tilts, and using an air attack in either direction produces a fair. Special moves tend to act as if the character is facing right. Knockback taken by these hitboxes will have no horizontal component. Getting hit by something else, using an f-smash, or using a side special will end the strangeness.

Flinchless
True=Hitbox does not cause flinching, False=Hitbox causes flinching
Stretchy
When set to 1, the hitbox will turn from a sphere into a tube, stretching from its position to the bone it's attached to. Basically, it starts at the bone with an offset of [0,0,0], it ends at the position it's specified at, and it also covers all the space in between.
